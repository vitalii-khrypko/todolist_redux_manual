# Todolist Redux Manual

Todolist Redux Manual is a React-based to-do list application that simulates Redux store functionality **without using the actual Redux library**. Instead of Redux, the state is managed at the top-level component and passed down through **props**, mimicking the unidirectional data flow of Redux.

## Technologies
- **React** - for building the user interface.
- **Props for state management** - instead of Redux, state is lifted up and passed down through components.
- **CSS3** - for styling the application.

## Features
- Add, remove, and mark tasks as completed.
- Centralized state management using a manually implemented store pattern.
- State is passed down via props to simulate Reduxâ€™s data flow.
- Simple and clean UI.
